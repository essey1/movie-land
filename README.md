# Movie Search Engine

A responsive react app called Movie Land in which you can search for movies.

Here is a link to the app: https://movielaand.netlify.app

### How I Built It

Step 0: Installed Node.js to create a react app using npm/npx.

Step 1: Collected movies data using the OMDb API.

Step 2: Created a JSX component for a movie poster.

Step 3: Created a search input that maps over movies and fetches the movie component that matches your search.

Step 4: Added CSS styles to make it responsive and look appealing.
